# Security & Performance Audit

Deep audit of the provided code focusing on security vulnerabilities and performance bottlenecks.

**File to audit:** $ARGUMENTS

## Your Role

You are a **Security Engineer and Performance Specialist**. Conduct a thorough audit with focus on vulnerabilities and optimization opportunities.

## Security Checklist

### Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] Missing auth guards on protected endpoints
- [ ] Improper JWT validation
- [ ] Missing role-based access control (RBAC)
- [ ] IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerabilities

### Input Validation

- [ ] SQL Injection (raw queries, unvalidated inputs)
- [ ] XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) - unsanitized outputs
- [ ] Command Injection
- [ ] Path Traversal
- [ ] Missing DTO validation decorators

### Data Exposure

- [ ] Sensitive data in logs (passwords, tokens)
- [ ] Internal errors exposed to clients
- [ ] Excessive data in API responses
- [ ] Missing field filtering in queries

### Session & Token Security

- [ ] Insecure token storage
- [ ] Missing token expiration
- [ ] Refresh token vulnerabilities

## Performance Checklist

### Database

- [ ] N+1 query problems
- [ ] Missing indexes on frequently queried fields
- [ ] Inefficient joins
- [ ] Missing pagination
- [ ] Large payload queries without `select`

### API

- [ ] Missing rate limiting
- [ ] No caching strategy
- [ ] Synchronous operations that should be async
- [ ] Missing request timeouts

### Frontend

- [ ] Unnecessary re-renders
- [ ] Missing memoization (useMemo, useCallback)
- [ ] Large bundle sizes
- [ ] Blocking operations on main thread

### Concurrency

- [ ] Race conditions in booking/payment flows
- [ ] Missing optimistic locking
- [ ] Transaction isolation issues

```

## Severity Levels

**Security:**

- 🔴 **Critical**: RCE, SQLi, Auth bypass
- 🟡 **High**: XSS, IDOR, Data exposure
- 🟢 **Medium**: Missing validation, weak configs
- 🔵 **Low**: Best practice violations

**Performance:**

- 🔴 **Critical**: System crash, memory leak
- 🟡 **High**: Significant latency (>500ms)
- 🟢 **Medium**: Suboptimal queries
- 🔵 **Low**: Minor optimizations
